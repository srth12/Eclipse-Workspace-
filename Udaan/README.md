**Details:**

1. The location is represented as a (x, y) coordinate.
2. Distance between two points (x1, y1) and(x2, y2) is  sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
3. Platform has decided upon maximum distance a driver has to travel to pickup a rider.
4. A cab has only 1 driver.
5. Sharing of cab is not allowed between riders
6. There is a single type of cab
7. End coordinate is not required to book a ride
Please build an application that exposes following features to riders and drivers.

1. Register a rider.
2. Register a driver/cab
3. Update a cab's location
4. A driver can switch on/off his availability
5. A rider can book a cab
6. A driver can end a ride

### Expectation from this round

1. Demonstrable code is first expectation. To do this, you can choose any interface you are comfortable with - CLI, WebApp, MobileApp, APIs or even simply run the code via Tests or a main method.
2. A good amount of focus is towards how well and thought-through the modeling of the problem and its various concepts are done. *(Do keep any future enhancements or extensibility in mind but don't get carried away with it).*
3. Clean professional level code.

4. Functional Completeness.
5. Rider/Driver Identification but not authentication.
6. Backend Database is optional. However modelling should be complete.
