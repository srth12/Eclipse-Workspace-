Assumptions made:
1. Only one request/user/timestamp possible in the
   current design. Multiple request with same userId
   and same timestamp won't work in the current design
2. Example in the pdf doesn't seems to be right as 
   the 'travelToCurrentGeoSuspicious' doesn't go 
   hand to hand with the 'precedingIpAccess'. Since, speed
   is 55 miles/hr 'travelToCurrentGeoSuspicious' should
   be false as it is less than 500 miles/hr. Similarly for
   'subsequentIpAccess' and 'travelFromCurrentGeoSuspicious'.
   So in my results, the output will be corrected.

Steps to run the code:
1. Run the command to bring up the spring boot application:
   './gradlew bootRun'
   
2. To access the endpoint, go to the URL: 
   http://localhost:8080/user/suspiciousLoginCheck
   
Sample request format:
   curl -X POST \
   http://localhost:8080/v1/user/event \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{
      "username": "bob",
      "unix_timestamp": 1514764801,
      "event_uuid": "85ad929a-db04-4bf4-9541-8f728fa12e42",
      "ip_address": "206.81.252.6"
   }'

Pending Tasks:
1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. Stress tests
4. containerize the application
