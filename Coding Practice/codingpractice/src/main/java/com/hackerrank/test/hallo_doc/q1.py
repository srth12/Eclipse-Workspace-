# You have to travel to different villages to make some profit.
# In each village, you gain some profit. But the catch is, from a particular village i, you can only move to a village j if and only if  and the profit gain from village j is a multiple of the profit gain from village i.
#
# You have to tell the maximum profit you can gain while traveling.
#
# Input format
#
# The first line contains a single integer N denoting the total number of villages.
# The second line contains N space-separated integers, each denoting the profit gain  from village i.
# Output format
#
# Print the maximum profit you can gain.
