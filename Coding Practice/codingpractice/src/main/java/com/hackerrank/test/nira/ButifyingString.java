 * You are given an integer n and you have to find total number of strings of length n which are beautiful.
 * A string is called beautiful if it is lexicographically (alphabetically) sorted and only consists of vowels ('a','e','i','o','u') .
 * Since the number of beautiful strings of length n can be very large, you have to print answer modulo 1000000007.
 *
 * Input Format:
 *
 * First line contains an integer t, number of test cases.
 * Each of next t lines contains a single integer integer n, the length of the string.
