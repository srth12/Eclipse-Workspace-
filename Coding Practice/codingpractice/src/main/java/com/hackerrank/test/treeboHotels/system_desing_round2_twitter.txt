Q. Twitter like system


Functional Use cases:
User should be able to post a tweet - text
User dashboard
He should able to see all his tweets
Home dashboard
User should be able to see all the tweets user is following - recently posted tweet first
Add Comments - ASCII


Estimation:-
No of tweets/sec expectation - 10k writes/sec
1M reads/sec
Avg length of the tweet - 140character
Storage requirements for 1 year =  10k writes/sec * 140 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 = 44.15 * 10^12 = 44.15PB/year
10years it will be around 440PB/ 10yr

     Bandwidth req:- 1M * 140 = ~ 140MB/sec

No of systems :- 1TB storage space per system
 = ~ 44,000 storage systems for 1 year
